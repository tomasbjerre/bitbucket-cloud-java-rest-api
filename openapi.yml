    The issue resources provide functionality for getting information on
    issues in an issue tracker, creating new issues, updating them and deleting
    them.

    You can access public issues without authentication, but you can't gain access
    to private repositories' issues. By authenticating, you will get the ability
    to create issues, as well as access to updating data or deleting issues you
    have access to.

    Webhooks provide a way to configure Bitbucket Cloud to make requests to
    your server (or another external service) whenever certain events occur in
    Bitbucket Cloud.

    A webhook consists of:

    * A subject -- The resource that generates the events. Currently, this resource
      is the repository, user account, or team where you create the webhook.
    * One or more event -- The default event is a repository push, but you can
      select multiple events that can trigger the webhook.
    * A URL -- The endpoint where you want Bitbucket to send the event payloads
      when a matching event happens.

    There are two parts to getting a webhook to work: creating the webhook and
    triggering the webhook. After you create a webhook for an event, every time
    that event occurs, Bitbucket sends a payload request that describes the event
    to the specified URL. Thus, you can think of webhooks as a kind of
    notification system.

    Use webhooks to integrate applications with Bitbucket Cloud. The following
    use cases provides examples of when you would want to use webhooks:

    * Every time a user pushes commits in a repository, you may want to notify
      your CI server to start a build.
    * Every time a user pushes commits or creates a pull request, you may want to
      display a notification in your application.

    Commit statuses provide a way to tag commits with meta data,
    like automated build results.

    Repository owners and administrators can set branch management
    rules on a repository that control what can be pushed by whom.
    Through these rules, you can enforce a project or team
    workflow. For example, owners or administrators can:

    * Limit push powers
    * Prevent branch (bookmark) deletion
    * Prevent history re-writes (Git only)

    Bitbucket Pipelines brings continuous delivery to Bitbucket
    Cloud, empowering teams with full branching to deployment
    visibility and faster feedback loops.
  name: pipelines
- description: |
    Teams are deploying code faster than ever, thanks to continuous
    delivery practices and tools like Bitbucket Pipelines. Bitbucket
    Deployments gives teams visibility into their deployment
    environments and helps teams to track how far changes have
    progressed in their deployment pipeline.

  /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/branching-model:
    get:
      description: |-
        Return the branching model as applied to the repository. This view is
        read-only. The branching model settings can be changed using the
        [settings](branching-model/settings#get) API.

        The returned object:

        1. Always has a `development` property. `development.branch` contains
           the actual repository branch object that is considered to be the
           `development` branch. `development.branch` will not be present
           if it does not exist.
        2. Might have a `production` property. `production` will not
           be present when `production` is disabled.
           `production.branch` contains the actual branch object that is
           considered to be the `production` branch. `production.branch` will
           not be present if it does not exist.
        3. Always has a `branch_types` array which contains all enabled branch
           types.

        Changes support [filtering and sorting](../../../meta/filtering) that
        can be used to search for specific changes. For instance, to see
        when an issue transitioned to "resolved":

        ```
        $ curl -s https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/site/master/issues/1/changes \
           -G --data-urlencode='q=changes.state.new = "resolved"'
        ```

        This resource is only available on repositories that have the issue
        tracker enabled.

        N.B.

        The `changes.assignee` and `changes.assignee_account_id` fields are not
        a `user` object. Instead, they contain the raw `username` and
        `account_id` of the user. This is to protect the integrity of the audit
        log even after a user account gets deleted.

        The `changes.assignee` field is deprecated will disappear in the
        future. Use `changes.assignee_account_id` instead.

        Makes a change to the specified issue.

        For example, to change an issue's state and assignee, create a new
        change object that modifies these fields:

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/site/master/issues/1234/changes \
          -s -u evzijst -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
            "changes": {
              "assignee_account_id": {
                "new": "557058:c0b72ad0-1cb5-4018-9cdc-0cde8492c443"
              },
              "state": {
                "new": 'resolved"
              }
            }
            "message": {
              "raw": "This is now resolved."
            }
          }'
        ```

        The above example also includes a custom comment to go alongside the
        change. This comment will also be visible on the issue page in the UI.

        The fields of the `changes` object are strings, not objects. This
        allows for immutable change log records, even after user accounts,
        milestones, or other objects recorded in a change entry, get renamed or
        deleted.

        The `assignee_account_id` field stores the account id. When POSTing a
        new change and changing the assignee, the client should therefore use
        the user's account_id in the `changes.assignee_account_id.new` field.

        This call requires authentication. Private repositories or private
        issue trackers require the caller to authenticate with an account that
        has appropriate authorization.

  /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/patch/{spec}:
    get:
      description: |-
        Produces a raw patch for a single commit (diffed against its first
        parent), or a patch-series for a revspec of 2 commits (e.g.
        `3a8b42..9ff173` where the first commit represents the source and the
        second commit the destination).

        In case of the latter (diffing a revspec), a patch series is returned
        for the commits on the source branch (`3a8b42` and its ancestors in
        our example). For Mercurial, a single patch is returned that combines
        the changes of all commits on the source branch.

        While similar to diffs, patches:

        * Have a commit header (username, commit message, etc)
        * Do not support the `path=foo/bar.py` query parameter

        The raw patch is returned as-is, in whatever encoding the files in the
        repository use. It is not decoded into unicode. As such, the
        content-type is `text/plain`.

            If the diff was too large and timed out.

            Since this endpoint does not employ any form of pagination, but
            instead returns the diff as a single document, it can run into
            trouble on very large diffs. If Bitbucket times out in cases
            like these, a 555 status code is returned.

      description: |-
        These are the repository's commits. They are paginated and returned
        in reverse chronological order, similar to the output of `git log` and
        `hg log`. Like these tools, the DAG can be filtered.

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/

        Returns all commits in the repo in topological order (newest commit
        first). All branches and tags are included (similar to
        `git log --all` and `hg log`).

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/master

        Returns all commits on rev `master` (similar to `git log master`,
        `hg log master`).

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/dev?exclude=master

        Returns all commits on ref `dev`, except those that are reachable on
        `master` (similar to `git log dev ^master`).

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?exclude=master

        Returns all commits in the repo that are not on master
        (similar to `git log --all ^master`).

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?include=foo&include=bar&exclude=fu&exclude=fubar

        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `fu` or
        `fubar` (similar to `git log foo bar ^fu ^fubar`).

        An optional `path` parameter can be specified that will limit the
        results to commits that affect that path. `path` can either be a file
        or a directory. If a directory is specified, commits are returned that
        have modified any file in the directory tree rooted by `path`. It is
        important to note that if the `path` parameter is specified, the commits
        returned by this endpoint may no longer be a DAG, parent commits that
        do not modify the path will be omitted from the response.

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?path=README.md&include=foo&include=bar&exclude=master

        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `master`
        that changed the file README.md.

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?path=src/&include=foo&include=bar&exclude=master

        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `master`
        that changed to a file in any file in the directory src or its children.

        Because the response could include a very large number of commits, it
        is paginated. Follow the 'next' link in the response to navigate to the
        next page of commits. As with other paginated resources, do not
        construct your own links.

        When the include and exclude parameters are more than can fit in a
        query string, clients can use a `x-www-form-urlencoded` POST instead.

        Update the branching model configuration for a repository.

        The `development` branch can be configured to a specific branch or to
        track the main branch. When set to a specific branch it must
        currently exist. Only the passed properties will be updated. The
        properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a
        `development` property will leave the development branch unchanged.

        It is possible for the `development` branch to be invalid. This
        happens when it points at a specific branch that has been
        deleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. It is
        not possible to update the settings for `development` if that
        would leave the branch in an invalid state. Such a request will be
        rejected.

        The `production` branch can be a specific branch, the main
        branch or disabled. When set to a specific branch it must currently
        exist. The `enabled` property can be used to enable (`true`) or
        disable (`false`) it. Only the passed properties will be updated. The
        properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a
        `production` property will leave the production branch unchanged.

        It is possible for the `production` branch to be invalid. This
        happens when it points at a specific branch that has been
        deleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. A
        request that would leave `production` enabled and invalid will be
        rejected. It is possible to update `production` and make it invalid if
        it would also be left disabled.

        The `branch_types` property contains the branch types to be updated.
        Only the branch types passed will be updated. All updates will be
        rejected if it would leave the branching model in an invalid state.
        For branch types this means that:

        1. The prefixes for all enabled branch types are valid. For example,
           it is not possible to use '*' inside a Git prefix.
        2. A prefix of an enabled branch type must not be a prefix of another
           enabled branch type. This is to ensure that a branch can be easily
           classified by its prefix unambiguously.

        It is possible to store an invalid prefix if that branch type would be
        left disabled. Only the passed properties will be updated. The
        properties not passed will be left unchanged. Each branch type must
        have a `kind` property to identify it.

        Creates a new webhook on the specified repository.

        Example:

        $ curl -X POST -u credentials -H 'Content-Type: application/json'           https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/hooks           -d '

        example above that means: `webhook`, `repository` and `issue`.

        Also note that the `url` must properly resolve and cannot be an
        internal, non-routed address.

        Returns the tags in the repository.

        By default, results will be in the order the underlying source control system returns them and identical to
        the ordering one sees when running "$ hg tags" or "$ git tag --list". Note that this follows simple
        lexical ordering of the ref names.

        This can be undesirable as it does apply any natural sorting semantics, meaning for instance that tags are
        sorted ["v10", "v11", "v9"] instead of ["v9", "v10", "v11"].

        Sorting can be changed using the ?sort= query parameter. When using ?sort=name to explicitly sort on ref name,
        Bitbucket will apply natural sorting and interpret numerical values as numbers instead of strings.

        This endpoint is used to create new commits in the repository by
        uploading files.

        To add a new file to a repository:

        ```
        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/src \
          -F /repo/path/to/image.png=@image.png
        ```

        This will create a new commit on top of the main branch, inheriting the
        contents of the main branch, but adding (or overwriting) the
        `image.png` file to the repository in the `/repo/path/to` directory.

        To create a commit that deletes files, use the `files` parameter:

        ```
        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/src \
          -F files=/file/to/delete/1.txt \
          -F files=/file/to/delete/2.txt
        ```

        You can add/modify/delete multiple files in a request. Rename/move a
        file by deleting the old path and adding the content at the new path.

        This endpoint accepts `multipart/form-data` (as in the examples above),
        as well as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

        ## multipart/form-data

        A `multipart/form-data` post contains a series of "form fields" that
        identify both the individual files that are being uploaded, as well as
        additional, optional meta data.

        Files are uploaded in file form fields (those that have a
        `Content-Disposition` parameter) whose field names point to the remote
        path in the repository where the file should be stored. Path field
        names are always interpreted to be absolute from the root of the
        repository, regardless whether the client uses a leading slash (as the
        above `curl` example did).

        File contents are treated as bytes and are not decoded as text.

        The commit message, as well as other non-file meta data for the
        request, is sent along as normal form field elements. Meta data fields
        share the same namespace as the file objects. For `multipart/form-data`
        bodies that should not lead to any ambiguity, as the
        `Content-Disposition` header will contain the `filename` parameter to
        distinguish between a file named "message" and the commit message field.

        ## application/x-www-form-urlencoded

        It is also possible to upload new files using a simple
        `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST. This can be convenient when
        uploading pure text files:

        ```
        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src \
          --data-urlencode "/path/to/me.txt=Lorem ipsum." \
          --data-urlencode "message=Initial commit" \
          --data-urlencode "author=Erik van Zijst <erik.van.zijst@gmail.com>"
        ```

        There could be a field name clash if a client were to upload a file
        named "message", as this filename clashes with the meta data property
        for the commit message. To avoid this and to upload files whose names
        clash with the meta data properties, use a leading slash for the files,
        e.g. `curl --data-urlencode "/message=file contents"`.

        When an explicit slash is omitted for a file whose path matches that of
        a meta data parameter, then it is interpreted as meta data, not as a
        file.

        ## Executables and links

        While this API aims to facilitate the most common use cases, it is
        possible to perform some more advanced operations like creating a new
        symlink in the repository, or creating an executable file.

        Files can be supplied with a `x-attributes` value in the
        `Content-Disposition` header. For example, to upload an executable
        file, as well as create a symlink from `README.txt` to `README`:

        ```
        --===============1438169132528273974==
        Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
        MIME-Version: 1.0
        Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
        Content-ID: "bin/shutdown.sh"
        Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="shutdown.sh"; x-attributes:"executable"

        #!/bin/sh
        halt

        --===============1438169132528273974==
        Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
        MIME-Version: 1.0
        Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
        Content-ID: "/README.txt"
        Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="README.txt"; x-attributes:"link"

        README
        --===============1438169132528273974==--
        ```

        Links are files that contain the target path and have
        `x-attributes:"link"` set.

        When overwriting links with files, or vice versa, the newly uploaded
        file determines both the new contents, as well as the attributes. That
        means uploading a file without specifying `x-attributes="link"` will
        create a regular file, even if the parent commit hosted a symlink at
        the same path.

        The same applies to executables. When modifying an existing executable
        file, the form-data file element must include
        `x-attributes="executable"` in order to preserve the executable status
        of the file.

        Note that this API does not support the creation or manipulation of
        subrepos / submodules.

          A comma-separated list of SHA1s of the commits that should

          When omitted, the new commit will inherit from and become
          a child of the main branch's tip/HEAD commit.

          When more than one SHA1 is provided, the first SHA1
          identifies the commit from which the content will be
          inherited.

          When more than 2 parents are provided on a Mercurial repo,
          a 400 is returned as Mercurial does not support octopus merges.

          type: string
      - description: |2

          Optional field that declares the files that the request is
          manipulating. When adding a new file to a repo, or when
          overwriting an existing file, the client can just upload
          the full contents of the file in a normal form field and
          the use of this `files` meta data field is redundant.
          However, when the `files` field contains a file path that
          does not have a corresponding, identically-named form
          field, then Bitbucket interprets that as the client wanting
          to replace the named file with the null set and the file is
          deleted instead.

          Paths in the repo that are referenced in neither files nor
          an individual file field, remain unchanged and carry over
          from the parent to the new commit.

          This API does not support renaming as an explicit feature.
          To rename a file, simply delete it and recreate it under
          the new name in the same commit.

          The name of the branch that the new commit should be
          created on. When omitted, the commit will be created on top
          of the main branch and will become the main branch's new
          HEAD/tip.

          When a branch name is provided that already exists in the
          repo, then the commit will be created on top of that
          branch. In this case, if a parent SHA1 was also provided,
          then it is asserted that the parent is the branch's
          tip/HEAD at the time the request is made. When this is not
          the case, a 409 is returned.

          This API cannot be used to create new anonymous heads in
          Mercurial repos.

          When a new branch name is specified (that does not already
          exist in the repo), and no parent SHA1s are provided, then
          the new commit will inherit from the current main branch's
          tip/HEAD commit, but not advance the main branch. The new
          commit will be the new branch. When the request also
          specifies a parent SHA1, then the new commit and branch
          are created directly on top of the parent commit,
          regardless of the state of the main branch.

          When a branch name is not specified, but a parent SHA1 is
          provided, then Bitbucket asserts that it represents the
          main branch's current HEAD/tip, or a 409 is returned.

          When a branch name is not specified and the repo is empty,
          the new commit will become the repo's root commit and will
          be on the main branch.

          When a branch name is specified and the repo is empty, the
          new commit will become the repo's root commit and also
          define the repo's main branch going forward.

          This API cannot be used to create additional root commits
          in non-empty repos.

          The branch field cannot be repeated.

          As a side effect, this API can be used to create a new
          branch without modifying any files, by specifying a new
          branch name in this field, together with parents, but
          omitting the files fields, while not sending any files.
          This will create a new commit and branch with the same
          contents as the first parent. The diff of this commit
          against its first parent will be empty.

        Branches support [filtering and sorting](../../../../../meta/filtering)
        that can be used to search for specific branches. For instance, to find
        all branches that have "stab" in their name:

        ```
        curl -s https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/seanfarley/mercurial/refs/branches -G --data-urlencode 'q=name ~ "stab"'
        ```

        By default, results will be in the order the underlying source control system returns them and identical to
        the ordering one sees when running "$ hg branches" or "$ git branch --list". Note that this follows simple
        lexical ordering of the ref names.

        This can be undesirable as it does apply any natural sorting semantics, meaning for instance that tags are
        sorted ["v10", "v11", "v9"] instead of ["v9", "v10", "v11"].

        Sorting can be changed using the ?q= query parameter. When using ?q=name to explicitly sort on ref name,
        Bitbucket will apply natural sorting and interpret numerical values as numbers instead of strings.

          [filtering and sorting](../../../../../../meta/filtering). The `name`
          field is handled specially for branches in that, if specified as the sort field, it
          uses a natural sort order instead of the default lexicographical sort order. For example,
          it will return ['branch1', 'branch2', 'branch10'] instead of ['branch1', 'branch10', 'branch2'].

        Creates a new branch in the specified repository.

        The payload of the POST should consist of a JSON document that
        contains the name of the tag and the target hash.

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/seanfarley/hg/refs/branches \
        -s -u seanfarley -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

                "hash" : "default",
            }
        }'
        ```

        This call requires authentication. Private repositories require the
        caller to authenticate with an account that has appropriate
        authorization.

        For Git, the branch name should not include any prefixes (e.g.
        refs/heads). This endpoint does support using short hash prefixes for
        the commit hash, but it may return a 400 response if the provided
        prefix is ambiguous. Using a full commit hash is the preferred
        approach.

        For Mercurial, the authenticated user making this call is the author of
        the new branch commit and the date is current datetime of the call.

  /snippets/{username}/{encoded_id}/{revision}/patch:
    get:
      description: |-
        Returns the patch of the specified commit against its first
        parent.

        Note that this resource is different in functionality from the `diff`
        resource.

        The differences between a diff and a patch are:

        * patches have a commit header with the username, message, etc
        * diffs support the optional `path=foo/bar.py` query param to filter the
          diff to just that one file diff (not supported for patches)
        * for a merge, the diff will show the diff between the merge commit and
          its first parent (identical to how PRs work), while patch returns a
          response containing separate patches for each commit on the second
          parent's ancestry, up to the oldest common ancestor (identical to
          its reachability).

        Note that the character encoding of the contents of the patch is
        unspecified as Git and Mercurial do not track this, making it hard for
        Bitbucket to reliably determine this.

        Creates a new repository.

        Note: In order to set the project for the newly created repository,
        pass in either the project key or the project UUID as part of the
        request body as shown in the examples below:

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "scm": "git",
            "project": {

            }
        }' https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/teamsinspace/hablanding
        ```

        or

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "scm": "git",
            "project": {

        The project must only be assigned for repositories belonging to a team.
        If the repository owner is a team and the project is not provided, the
        repository is automatically assigned to the oldest project in the team.

        Note: In the examples above, the username `teamsinspace`,
        and/or the repository name `hablanding` can be replaced by UUIDs.

        Since this endpoint can be used to both update and to create a
        repository, the request body depends on the intent.

        ### Creation

        See the POST documentation for the repository endpoint for an example
        of the request body.

        ### Update

        Note: Changing the `name` of the repository will cause the location to
        be changed. This is because the URL of the repo is derived from the
        name (a process called slugification). In such a scenario, it is
        possible for the request to fail if the newly created slug conflicts
        with an existing repository's slug. But if there is no conflict,
        the new location will be returned in the `Location` header of the
        response.

        Returns all pull requests on the specified repository.

        By default only open pull requests are returned. This can be controlled
        using the `state` query parameter. To retrieve pull requests that are
        in one of multiple states, repeat the `state` parameter for each
        individual state.

        This endpoint also supports filtering and sorting of the results. See
        [filtering and sorting](../../../../meta/filtering) for more details.

        Creates a new pull request where the destination repository is
        this repository and the author is the authenticated user.

        The minimum required fields to create a pull request are `title` and
        `source`, specified by a branch name.

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/my-username/my-repository/pullrequests \
            -u my-username:my-password \
            --request POST \
            --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            --data '{
                "title": "My Title",
                "source": {
                    "branch": {
                        "name": "staging"
                    }
                }
            }'
        ```

        If the pull request's `destination` is not specified, it will default
        to the `repository.mainbranch`. To open a pull request to a
        different branch, say from a feature branch to a staging branch,
        specify a `destination` (same format as the `source`):

        ```
        {
            "title": "My Title",
            "source": {
                "branch": {
                    "name": "my-feature-branch"
                }
            },
            "destination": {
                "branch": {
                    "name": "staging"
                }
            }
        }
        ```

        Reviewers can be specified by adding an array of user objects as the
        `reviewers` property.

        ```
        {
            "title": "My Title",

          The request URL you POST to becomes the destination repository URL. For this reason, you must specify an explicit source repository in the request object if you want to pull from a different repository (fork).

          Since not all elements are required or even mutable, you only need to include the elements you want to initialize, such as the source branch and the title.

        $ curl -X POST -u jdoe https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/dogslow/forks \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
            "name": "dogslow_fork"
        }'
        ```

        When you specify a value for `name`, it will also affect the `slug`.
        The `slug` is reflected in the repository URL of the new fork. It is
        derived from `name` by substituting non-ASCII characters, removes
        whitespace, and changes characters to lower case. For example,
        `My repo` would turn into `my_repo`.

        ## Forking a repository into a team account

        To create a fork into a team account, specify the new owner's account
        explicitly as part of the request body. This prevents forked
        repositories from being owned by the authenticated user submitting the
        request:

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -u jdoe https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/forks \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
            "name": "bbql_fork",
            "owner": {
              "username": "atlassian"
            }
        }'
        ```

        To fork a repository into the same team, also specify a new `name`.

        You need contributor access to create new forks within a team account.


        ## Change the properties of a new fork

        By default the fork inherits most of its properties from the parent.
        However, since the optional POST body document follows the normal
        `repository` JSON schema and you can override the new fork's
        properties.

        Properties that can be overridden include:

        * description
        * fork_policy
        * language
        * mainbranch
        * is_private (note that a private repo's fork_policy might prohibit
          the creation of public forks, in which `is_private=False` would fail)
        * has_issues (to initialize or disable the new repo's issue tracker --
          note that the actual contents of the parent repository's issue
          tracker are not copied during forking)
        * has_wiki (to initialize or disable the new repo's wiki --
          note that the actual contents of the parent repository's wiki are not
          copied during forking)
        * project (only teams have projects and when forking into a private
          project, the fork's `is_private` must be `true`)

        Properties that cannot be modified include:

        * scm
        * parent
        * full_name
      parameters:
      - description: |

        Retrieves a single snippet.

        Snippets support multiple content types:

        * application/json
        * multipart/related
        * multipart/form-data


        application/json
        ----------------

        The default content type of the response is `application/json`.
        Since JSON is always `utf-8`, it cannot reliably contain file contents
        for files that are not text. Therefore, JSON snippet documents only
        contain the filename and links to the file contents.

        This means that in order to retrieve all parts of a snippet, N+1
        requests need to be made (where N is the number of files in the
        snippet).


        multipart/related
        -----------------

        To retrieve an entire snippet in a single response, use the
        `Accept: multipart/related` HTTP request header.

            $ curl -H "Accept: multipart/related" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/1

        multipart/form-data
        -------------------

        As with creating new snippets, `multipart/form-data` can be used as an
        alternative to `multipart/related`. However, the inherently flat
        structure of form-data means that only basic, root-level properties
        can be returned, while nested elements like `links` are omitted:

            $ curl -H "Accept: multipart/form-data" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj

        Response:

      description: |-
        Used to update a snippet. Use this to add and delete files and to
        change a snippet's title.

        To update a snippet, one can either PUT a full snapshot, or only the
        parts that need to be changed.

        The contract for PUT on this API is that properties missing from the
        request remain untouched so that snippets can be efficiently
        manipulated with differential payloads.

        To delete a property (e.g. the title, or a file), include its name in
        the request, but omit its value (use `null`).

        As in Git, explicit renaming of files is not supported. Instead, to
        rename a file, delete it and add it again under another name. This can
        be done atomically in a single request. Rename detection is left to
        the SCM.

        PUT supports three different content types for both request and
        response bodies:

        * `application/json`
        * `multipart/related`
        * `multipart/form-data`

        The content type used for the request body can be different than that
        used for the response. Content types are specified using standard HTTP
        headers.

        Use the `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers to select the desired
        request and response format.


        application/json
        ----------------

        As with creation and retrieval, the content type determines what
        properties can be manipulated. `application/json` does not support
        file contents and is therefore limited to a snippet's meta data.

        To update the title, without changing any of its files:

            $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -d '{"title": "Updated title"}'


        To delete the title:

            $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -d '{"title": null}'

        Not all parts of a snippet can be manipulated. The owner and creator
        for instance are immutable.


        multipart/related
        -----------------

        `multipart/related` can be used to manipulate all of a snippet's
        properties. The body is identical to a POST. properties omitted from
        the request are left unchanged. Since the `start` part contains JSON,
        the mechanism for manipulating the snippet's meta data is identical
        to `application/json` requests.

        To update one of a snippet's file contents, while also changing its
        title:

            PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 288
            Content-Type: multipart/related; start="snippet"; boundary="===============1438169132528273974=="
            MIME-Version: 1.0

            --===============1438169132528273974==
            Content-Type: application/json; charset="utf-8"
            MIME-Version: 1.0
            Content-ID: snippet

            {
              "title": "My updated snippet",
              "files": {
                  "foo.txt": {}
                }
            }

            --===============1438169132528273974==
            Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
            MIME-Version: 1.0
            Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
            Content-ID: "foo.txt"
            Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="foo.txt"

            Updated file contents.

            --===============1438169132528273974==--

        Here only the parts that are changed are included in the body. The
        other files remain untouched.

        Note the use of the `files` list in the JSON part. This list contains
        the files that are being manipulated. This list should have
        corresponding multiparts in the request that contain the new contents
        of these files.

        If a filename in the `files` list does not have a corresponding part,
        it will be deleted from the snippet, as shown below:

            PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 188
            Content-Type: multipart/related; start="snippet"; boundary="===============1438169132528273974=="
            MIME-Version: 1.0

            --===============1438169132528273974==
            Content-Type: application/json; charset="utf-8"
            MIME-Version: 1.0
            Content-ID: snippet

            {
              "files": {
                "image.png": {}
              }
            }

            --===============1438169132528273974==--

        To simulate a rename, delete a file and add the same file under
        another name:

            PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 212
            Content-Type: multipart/related; start="snippet"; boundary="===============1438169132528273974=="
            MIME-Version: 1.0

            --===============1438169132528273974==
            Content-Type: application/json; charset="utf-8"
            MIME-Version: 1.0
            Content-ID: snippet

            {
                "files": {
                  "foo.txt": {},
                  "bar.txt": {}
                }
            }

            --===============1438169132528273974==

            Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="bar.txt"

            foo

            --===============1438169132528273974==--


        multipart/form-data
        -----------------

        Again, one can also use `multipart/form-data` to manipulate file
        contents and meta data atomically.

            $ curl -X PUT http://localhost:12345/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -F title="My updated snippet" -F file=@foo.txt

            PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 351
            Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f

            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="foo.txt"
            Content-Type: text/plain

            foo

            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"

            My updated snippet
            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f

        To delete a file, omit its contents while including its name in the
        `files` field:

            $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj -F files=image.png

            PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 149
            Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------ef8871065a86

            ------------------------------ef8871065a86
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="files"

            image.png
            ------------------------------ef8871065a86--

        The explicit use of the `files` element in `multipart/related` and
        `multipart/form-data` is only required when deleting files.
        The default mode of operation is for file parts to be processed,
        regardless of whether or not they are listed in `files`, as a
        convenience to the client.

  /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/diff/{spec}:
    get:
      description: |-
        Produces a raw, git-style diff for either a single commit (diffed
        against its first parent), or a revspec of 2 commits (e.g.
        `3a8b42..9ff173` where the first commit represents the source and the
        second commit the destination).

        In case of the latter (diffing a revspec), a 3-way diff, or merge diff,
        is computed. This shows the changes introduced by the left branch
        (`3a8b42` in our example) as compared againt the right branch
        (`9ff173`).

        This is equivalent to merging the left branch into the right branch and
        then computing the diff of the merge commit against its first parent
        (the right branch). This follows the same behavior as pull requests
        that also show this style of 3-way, or merge diff.

        While similar to patches, diffs:

        * Don't have a commit header (username, commit message, etc)
        * Support the optional `path=foo/bar.py` query param to filter
          the diff to just that one file diff

        The raw diff is returned as-is, in whatever encoding the files in the
        repository use. It is not decoded into unicode. As such, the
        content-type is `text/plain`.

            Since this endpoint does not employ any form of pagination, but
            instead returns the diff as a single document, it can run into
            trouble on very large diffs. If Bitbucket times out in cases
            like these, a 555 status code is returned.

  /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commit/{node}/statuses/build:
    post:
      description: |-
        Creates a new build status against the specified commit.

        If the specified key already exists, the existing status object will
        be overwritten.

        When creating a new commit status, you can use a URI template for the URL.
        Templates are URLs that contain variable names that Bitbucket will
        evaluate at runtime whenever the URL is displayed anywhere similar to
        parameter substitution in
        [Bitbucket Connect](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/concepts/context-parameters.html).
        For example, one could use `https://foo.com/builds/{repository.full_name}`
        which Bitbucket will turn into `https://foo.com/builds/foo/bar` at render time.
        The context variables available are `repository` and `commit`.
      parameters:
      - description: |
          This can either be the username or the UUID of the account,
          surrounded by curly-braces, for example: `{account UUID}`. An account
          is either a team or user.

        Deletes the snippet.

        Note that this only works for versioned URLs that point to the latest
        commit of the snippet. Pointing to an older commit results in a 405
        status code.

        To delete a snippet, regardless of whether or not concurrent changes
        are being made to it, use `DELETE /snippets/{encoded_id}` instead.

        Identical to `UPDATE /snippets/encoded_id`, except that this endpoint

        (most recent) version can be updated and requests on all other,
        older revisions fail by returning a 405 status.

        Usage of this endpoint over the unrestricted `/snippets/encoded_id`
        could be desired if the caller wants to be sure no concurrent
        modifications have taken place between the moment of the UPDATE
        request and the original GET.

        This can be considered a so-called "Compare And Swap", or CAS
        operation.

  /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/refs:
    get:
      description: |-
        Returns the branches and tags in the repository.

        By default, results will be in the order the underlying source control system returns them and identical to
        the ordering one sees when running "$ git show-ref". Note that this follows simple
        lexical ordering of the ref names.

        This can be undesirable as it does apply any natural sorting semantics, meaning for instance that refs are
        sorted ["branch1", "branch10", "branch2", "v10", "v11", "v9"] instead of ["branch1", "branch2",
        "branch10", "v9", "v10", "v11"].

        Sorting can be changed using the ?sort= query parameter. When using ?sort=name to explicitly sort on ref name,
        Bitbucket will apply natural sorting and interpret numerical values as numbers instead of strings.
      parameters:

      description: |-
        Returns the diff of the specified commit against its first parent.

        Note that this resource is different in functionality from the `patch`
        resource.

        The differences between a diff and a patch are:

        * patches have a commit header with the username, message, etc
        * diffs support the optional `path=foo/bar.py` query param to filter the
          diff to just that one file diff (not supported for patches)
        * for a merge, the diff will show the diff between the merge commit and
          its first parent (identical to how PRs work), while patch returns a
          response containing separate patches for each commit on the second
          parent's ancestry, up to the oldest common ancestor (identical to
          its reachability).

        Note that the character encoding of the contents of the diff is
        unspecified as Git and Mercurial do not track this, making it hard for
        Bitbucket to reliably determine this.

        Returns a paginated list of all repositories owned by the specified
        account or UUID.

        The result can be narrowed down based on the authenticated user's role.

        E.g. with `?role=contributor`, only those repositories that the

    get:
      description: |-
        Returns all snippets. Like pull requests, repositories and teams, the
        full set of snippets is defined by what the current user has access to.

        This includes all snippets owned by the current user, but also all snippets
        owned by any of the teams the user is a member of, or snippets by other
        users that the current user is either watching or has collaborated on (for
        instance by commenting on it).

        To limit the set of returned snippets, apply the
        `?role=[owner|contributor|member]` query parameter where the roles are
        defined as follows:

        * `owner`: all snippets owned by the current user
        * `contributor`: all snippets owned by, or watched by the current user
        * `member`: owned by the user, their teams, or watched by the current user

        When no role is specified, all public snippets are returned, as well as all
        privately owned snippets watched or commented on.

        The returned response is a normal paginated JSON list. This endpoint
        only supports `application/json` responses and no
        `multipart/form-data` or `multipart/related`. As a result, it is not
        possible to include the file contents.

        Creates a new snippet under the authenticated user's account.

        Snippets can contain multiple files. Both text and binary files are
        supported.

        The simplest way to create a new snippet from a local file:

            $ curl -u username:password -X POST https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets               -F file=@image.png

        Creating snippets through curl has a few limitations and so let's look
        at a more complicated scenario.

        Snippets are created with a multipart POST. Both `multipart/form-data`
        and `multipart/related` are supported. Both allow the creation of
        snippets with both meta data (title, etc), as well as multiple text
        and binary files.

        The main difference is that `multipart/related` can use rich encoding
        for the meta data (currently JSON).


        multipart/related (RFC-2387)
        ----------------------------

        This is the most advanced and efficient way to create a paste.

        The request contains multiple parts and is structured as follows.

        The first part is the JSON document that describes the snippet's
        properties or meta data. It either has to be the first part, or the
        request's `Content-Type` header must contain the `start` parameter to
        point to it.

        The remaining parts are the files of which there can be zero or more.
        Each file part should contain the `Content-ID` MIME header through
        which the JSON meta data's `files` element addresses it. The value
        should be the name of the file.

        `Content-Disposition` is an optional MIME header. The header's
        optional `filename` parameter can be used to specify the file name
        that Bitbucket should use when writing the file to disk. When present,
        `filename` takes precedence over the value of `Content-ID`.

        When the JSON body omits the `files` element, the remaining parts are
        not ignored. Instead, each file is added to the new snippet as if its
        name was explicitly linked (the use of the `files` elements is
        mandatory for some operations like deleting or renaming files).


        multipart/form-data
        -------------------

        The use of JSON for the snippet's meta data is optional. Meta data can
        also be supplied as regular form fields in a more conventional
        `multipart/form-data` request:

            $ curl -X POST -u credentials https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets               -F title="My snippet"               -F file=@foo.txt -F file=@image.png

            POST /2.0/snippets HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 951
            Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f

            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="foo.txt"
            Content-Type: text/plain

            foo

            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="image.png"
            Content-Type: application/octet-stream

            ?PNG

            IHDR?1??I.....
            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"

            My snippet
            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f--

        Here the meta data properties are included as flat, top-level form
        fields. The file attachments use the `file` field name. To attach
        multiple files, simply repeat the field.

        The advantage of `multipart/form-data` over `multipart/related` is
        that it can be easier to build clients.

        Essentially all properties are optional, `title` and `files` included.


        Sharing and Visibility
        ----------------------

        Snippets can be either public (visible to anyone on Bitbucket, as well
        as anonymous users), or private (visible only to the owner, creator
        and members of the team in case the snippet is owned by a team). This
        is controlled through the snippet's `is_private` element:

        * **is_private=false** -- everyone, including anonymous users can view
          the snippet
        * **is_private=true** -- only the owner and team members (for team
          snippets) can view it

        To create the snippet under a team account, just append the team name
        to the URL (see `/2.0/snippets/{username}`).

  /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/src/{node}/{path}:
    get:
      description: |-
        This endpoints is used to retrieve the contents of a single file,
        or the contents of a directory at a specified revision.

        ## Raw file contents

        When `path` points to a file, this endpoint returns the raw contents.
        The response's Content-Type is derived from the filename
        extension (not from the contents). The file contents are not processed
        and no character encoding/recoding is performed and as a result no
        character encoding is included as part of the Content-Type.

        The `Content-Disposition` header will be "attachment" to prevent
        browsers from running executable files.

        If the file is managed by LFS, then a 301 redirect pointing to
        Atlassian's media services platform is returned.

        The response includes an ETag that is based on the contents of the file
        and its attributes. This means that an empty `__init__.py` always
        returns the same ETag, regardless on the directory it lives in, or the
        commit it is on.

        ## File meta data

        When the request for a file path includes the query parameter
        `?format=meta`, instead of returning the file's raw contents, Bitbucket
        instead returns the JSON object describing the file's properties:

        ```javascript
        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests/__init__.py?format=meta
        {
          "links": {
            "self": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py"
            },
            "meta": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py?format=meta"
            }
          },
          "path": "tests/__init__.py",
          "commit": {
            "type": "commit",
            "hash": "eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335",
            "links": {
              "self": {
                "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"
              },
              "html": {
                "href": "https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"
              }
            }
          },
          "attributes": [],
          "type": "commit_file",
          "size": 0
        }
        ```

        File objects contain an `attributes` element that contains a list of
        possible modifiers. Currently defined values are:

        * `link` -- indicates that the entry is a symbolic link. The contents
            of the file represent the path the link points to.
        * `executable` -- indicates that the file has the executable bit set.
        * `subrepository` -- indicates that the entry points to a submodule or
            subrepo. The contents of the file is the SHA1 of the repository
            pointed to.
        * `binary` -- indicates whether Bitbucket thinks the file is binary.

        This endpoint can provide an alternative to how a HEAD request can be
        used to check for the existence of a file, or a file's size without
        incurring the overhead of receiving its full contents.


        ## Directory listings

        When `path` points to a directory instead of a file, the response is a
        paginated list of directory and file objects in the same order as the
        underlying SCM system would return them.

        For example:

        ```javascript
        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests
        {
          "pagelen": 10,
          "values": [
            {
              "path": "tests/test_project",
              "type": "commit_directory",
              "links": {
                "self": {
                  "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/"
                },
                "meta": {
                  "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/?format=meta"
                }
              },
              "commit": {
                "type": "commit",
                "hash": "eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335",

                  },
                  "html": {
                    "href": "https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"
                  }

            }
          ],
          "page": 1,
          "size": 2
        }
        ```

        When listing the contents of the repo's root directory, the use of a
        trailing slash at the end of the URL is required.

        The response by default is not recursive, meaning that only the direct contents of
        a path are returned. The response does not recurse down into
        subdirectories. In order to "walk" the entire directory tree, the
        client can either parse each response and follow the `self` links of each
        `commit_directory` object, or can specify a `max_depth` to recurse to.

        The max_depth parameter will do a breadth-first search to return the contents of the subdirectories
        up to the depth specified. Breadth-first search was chosen as it leads to the least amount of
        file system operations for git. If the `max_depth` parameter is specified to be too
        large, the call will time out and return a 555.

        Each returned object is either a `commit_file`, or a `commit_directory`,
        both of which contain a `path` element. This path is the absolute path
        from the root of the repository. Each object also contains a `commit`
        object which embeds the commit the file is on. Note that this is merely
        the commit that was used in the URL. It is *not* the commit that last
        modified the file.

        Directory objects have 2 representations. Their `self` link returns the
        paginated contents of the directory. The `meta` link on the other hand
        returns the actual `directory` object itself, e.g.:

        ```javascript
        {
          "path": "tests/test_project",
          "type": "commit_directory",
          "links": {
            "self": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/"
            },
            "meta": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/?format=meta"
            }
          },
          "commit": { ... }
        }
        ```

        ## Querying, filtering and sorting

        Like most API endpoints, this API supports the Bitbucket
        querying/filtering syntax and so you could filter a directory listing
        to only include entries that match certain criteria. For instance, to
        list all binary files over 1kb use the expression:

        `size > 1024 and attributes = "binary"`

        which after urlencoding yields the query string:

        `?q=size%3E1024+and+attributes%3D%22binary%22`

        To change the ordering of the response, use the `?sort` parameter:

        `.../src/eefd5ef/?sort=-size`

        See [filtering and sorting](../../../../../../meta/filtering) for more
        details.

          track what text encoding scheme is used, this endpoint attempts to detect
          the most appropriate character encoding. While usually correct, determining
          the character encoding can be ambiguous which in exceptional cases can lead
          to misinterpretation of the characters. As such, the raw element in the
          response object should not be treated as equivalent to the file's actual
          contents.

        These are the repository's commits. They are paginated and returned
        in reverse chronological order, similar to the output of `git log` and
        `hg log`. Like these tools, the DAG can be filtered.

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/

        Returns all commits in the repo in topological order (newest commit
        first). All branches and tags are included (similar to
        `git log --all` and `hg log`).

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/master

        Returns all commits on rev `master` (similar to `git log master`,
        `hg log master`).

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/dev?exclude=master

        Returns all commits on ref `dev`, except those that are reachable on
        `master` (similar to `git log dev ^master`).

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?exclude=master

        Returns all commits in the repo that are not on master
        (similar to `git log --all ^master`).

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?include=foo&include=bar&exclude=fu&exclude=fubar

        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `fu` or
        `fubar` (similar to `git log foo bar ^fu ^fubar`).

        An optional `path` parameter can be specified that will limit the
        results to commits that affect that path. `path` can either be a file
        or a directory. If a directory is specified, commits are returned that
        have modified any file in the directory tree rooted by `path`. It is
        important to note that if the `path` parameter is specified, the commits
        returned by this endpoint may no longer be a DAG, parent commits that
        do not modify the path will be omitted from the response.

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?path=README.md&include=foo&include=bar&exclude=master

        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `master`
        that changed the file README.md.

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?path=src/&include=foo&include=bar&exclude=master

        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `master`
        that changed to a file in any file in the directory src or its children.

        Because the response could include a very large number of commits, it
        is paginated. Follow the 'next' link in the response to navigate to the
        next page of commits. As with other paginated resources, do not
        construct your own links.

        When the include and exclude parameters are more than can fit in a
        query string, clients can use a `x-www-form-urlencoded` POST instead.

        Creates a new branch restriction rule for a repository.

        `kind` describes what will be restricted. Allowed values include:
        `push`, `force`, `delete` and `restrict_merges`.

        Different kinds of branch restrictions have different requirements:

        * `push` and `restrict_merges` require `users` and `groups` to be
          specified. Empty lists are allowed, in which case permission is
          denied for everybody.
        * `force` can not be specified in a Mercurial repository.

        The restriction applies to all branches that match. There are
        two ways to match a branch. It is configured in `branch_match_kind`:

        1. `glob`: Matches a branch against the `pattern`. A `'*'` in
           `pattern` will expand to match zero or more characters, and every
           other character matches itself. For example, `'foo*'` will match
           `'foo'` and `'foobar'`, but not `'barfoo'`. `'*'` will match all
           branches.
        2. `branching_model`: Matches a branch against the repository's
           branching model. The `branch_type` controls the type of branch
           to match. Allowed values include: `production`, `development`,
           `bugfix`, `release`, `feature` and `hotfix`.

        The combination of `kind` and match must be unique. This means that
        two `glob` restrictions in a repository cannot have the same `kind` and
        `pattern`. Additionally, two `branching_model` restrictions in a
        repository cannot have the same `kind` and `branch_type`.

        `users` and `groups` are lists of users and groups that are except from
        the restriction. They can only be configured in `push` and
        `restrict_merges` restrictions. The `push` restriction stops a user
        pushing to matching branches unless that user is in `users` or is a
        member of a group in `groups`. The `restrict_merges` stops a user
        merging pull requests to matching branches unless that user is in
        `users` or is a member of a group in `groups`. Adding new users or
        groups to an existing restriction should be done via `PUT`.

        Note that branch restrictions with overlapping matchers is allowed,
        but the resulting behavior may be surprising.

        This endpoint is used to poll for the progress of an issue export
        job and return the zip file after the job is complete.
        As long as the job is running, this will return a 200 response
        with in the response body a description of the current status.

        After the job has been scheduled, but before it starts executing, this
        endpoint's response is:

        {
         "type": "issue_job_status",
         "status": "ACCEPTED",

         "total": 0,
         "count": 0,
         "pct": 0
        }


        Then once it starts running, it becomes:

        {
         "type": "issue_job_status",
         "status": "STARTED",
         "phase": "Attachments",
         "total": 15,
         "count": 11,
         "pct": 73
        }

        Once the job has successfully completed, it returns a stream of the zip file.

      description: "Endpoint to create and initiate a pipeline. \nThere are a couple\
        \ of different options to initiate a pipeline, where the payload of the request\
        \ will determine which type of pipeline will be instantiated.\n# Trigger a\
        \ Pipeline for a branch\nOne way to trigger pipelines is by specifying the\
        \ branch for which you want to trigger a pipeline. \nThe specified branch\
        \ will be used to determine which pipeline definition from the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`\
        \ file will be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will then do\
        \ a clone of the repository and checkout the latest revision of the specified\
        \ branch.\n\n### Example\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\\
        \n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/\

        \     \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\", \n      \"ref_name\": \"master\"\n\
        \    }\n  }'\n```\n# Trigger a Pipeline for a commit on a branch or tag\n\
        You can initiate a pipeline for a specific commit and in the context of a\
        \ specified reference (e.g. a branch, tag or bookmark).\nThe specified reference\
        \ will be used to determine which pipeline definition from the bitbucket-pipelines.yml\
        \ file will be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will clone the\
        \ repository and then do a checkout the specified reference. \n\nThe following\
        \ reference types are supported:\n\n* `branch` \n* `named_branch`\n* `bookmark`\
        \ \n * `tag`\n\n### Example\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -is -u username:password\

        , \n      \"ref_name\": \"master\"\n    }\n  }'\n```\n# Trigger a specific\
        \ pipeline definition for a commit\nYou can trigger a specific pipeline that\
        \ is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit.\
        \ \nIn addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of\
        \ the selector that identifies the pipeline definition. The resulting pipeline\
        \ will then clone the repository and checkout the specified revision.\n\n\
        ### Example\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\\n  -H 'Content-Type:\

      description: |-
        POST a new custom event.

        The data within the event body will be hydrated by Bitbucket. For example, the following event
        submission would result in subscribers for the event receiving the full repository object
        corresponding to the UUID.

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "mynumdata": "12345",
            "repository": {
                "type": "repository",
                "uuid": "{be95aa1f-c0b2-47f6-99d1-bf5d3a0f850f}"
        }}' https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/addon/users/myuser/events/com.example.app%3Amyevent
        ```

        Use the optional `fields` property of the custom event Connect
        module where the event is defined to add additional
        fields to the expanded payload sent to listeners.

        For example, the `customEvents` module in the app descriptor for the previous example would look like this:

        ```
        'modules': {
            'customEvents': {
                'com.example.app:myevent': {
                    'schema': {
                        'properties': {
                            'mynumdata': {'type': 'number'},
                            'repository': {'$ref': '#/definitions/repository'}
                        }
                    },
                    'fields': ['repository.owner']
                }
            }
        }
        ```

        By specifying fields as above, the repository owner
        will also be sent to subscribers of the event.

        Returns a paginated list of commits that modified the specified file.

        Commits are returned in reverse chronological order. This is roughly
        equivalent to the following commands:

            $ git log --follow --date-order <sha> <path>

            $ hg log --follow <path>

        By default, Bitbucket will follow renames and the path name in the
        returned entries reflects that. This can be turned off using the
        `?renames=false` query parameter.

        Results are returned in descending chronological order by default, and
        like most endpoints you can
        [filter and sort](../../../../../../meta/filtering) the response to
        only provide exactly the data you want.

        For example, if you wanted to find commits made before 2011-05-18
        against a file named `README.rst`, but you only wanted the path and
        date, your query would look like this:

        ```
        $ curl 'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/dogslow/filehistory/master/README.rst'\
          '?fields=values.next,values.path,values.commit.date&q=commit.date<=2011-05-18'
        {
          "values": [
            {
              "commit": {
                "date": "2011-05-17T07:32:09+00:00"
              },
              "path": "README.rst"
            },
            {
              "commit": {
                "date": "2011-05-16T06:33:28+00:00"
              },
              "path": "README.txt"
            },
            {
              "commit": {
                "date": "2011-05-16T06:15:39+00:00"
              },
              "path": "README.txt"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        In the response you can see that the file was renamed to `README.rst`
        by the commit made on 2011-05-16, and was previously named `README.txt`.

        refs/heads). For Mercurial, this closes all open heads on the branch,
        sets the author of the commit to the authenticated caller, and changes
        the date to the datetime of the call.

        This call requires authentication. Private repositories require the
        caller to authenticate with an account that has appropriate
        authorization.

        For Git, the branch name should not include any prefixes (e.g.
        refs/heads).

        For Mercurial, the response will include an additional field that lists
        the open heads.

        Since this endpoint can be used to both update and to create a
        project, the request body depends on the intent.

        ### Creation

        See the POST documentation for the project collection for an
        example of the request body.

        Note: The `key` should not be specified in the body of request
        (since it is already present in the URL). The `name` is required,
        everything else is optional.

        ### Update

        See the POST documentation for the project collection for an
        example of the request body.

        Note: The key is not required in the body (since it is already in
        the URL). The key may be specified in the body, if the intent is
        to change the key itself. In such a scenario, the location of the
        project is changed and is returned in the `Location` header of the
        response.
